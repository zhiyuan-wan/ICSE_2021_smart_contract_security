# What the artifacts do:

The artifact includes:
1) an interview guide that we used for our semi-structured interviews (PDF);
> Note that the transcripts cannot be part of the artifact according the confidentiality and privacy clauses as specified in our IRB.
2) a questionnaire that we used for our online survey (PDF);
3) the valid responses of our online survey (CSV).

# How to use the artifacts:

As for the interview guide and questionnaire, future work could:
1) conduct an exploratory study to investigate security practices of some domains other than smart contracts by using or modifying our interview guide and questionnaire;
2) extend our study by looking at other aspects related to smart contracts.

As for the valid responses, future work could extend our study by building models for the survey responses to dig for more findings and implications.
